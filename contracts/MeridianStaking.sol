/**
 * @title MeridianStaking
 * @notice Flexible staking pool for a single ERC-20 token (MRDN). Stakers
 *         deposit tokens and continuously accrue rewards, paid from a
 *         separately funded reward pool, for as long as they remain staked.
 *         Stakers may unstake their full principal at any time.
 * @dev Design goals, matching LaunchToken.sol's minimal-admin philosophy:
 *
 * - The owner can NEVER withdraw, freeze, or move a staker's principal.
 *   `stake()` and `unstake()` are only callable by the staker themself on
 *   their own balance.
 * - The owner's only powers are: (1) set the reward rate going forward,
 *   and (2) top up the reward pool by depositing more reward tokens. There
 *   is no owner function that pulls tokens OUT of the contract to the
 *   owner's own wallet.
 * - No blacklist, no pause, no upgradeability, no hidden mint (this
 *   contract does not mint tokens at all — rewards are paid only from
 *   tokens the owner has deposited into the pool in advance).
 * - Reward accounting uses the standard accumulated-reward-per-token
 *   pattern (as used by widely reviewed staking contracts such as
 *   Synthetix StakingRewards), which avoids unbounded loops over stakers.
 *
 * This contract has NOT been independently audited. See the project's
 * SECURITY_REVIEW.md before any mainnet deployment or public use.
